The files I have used here are the .dat files from the OneDrive. Collar heights change every year so please measure height in three places within a collar and use the means in the heights df.
```{r}

chamber <- c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12") #please keep this as a character
Average_Height <- c(4.85, 4.9, 5.85, 4.45, 5.75,5.15, 4.8, 4.3, 5.50, 4.3, 3.6, 4)
