# Harvard Forest REU 2023
This is code I used this summer that I believe will be helpful for the Carbon supergroup and future REU students. R markdowns with images are available in the lab drive, Data->hemlock->Respiration collars: data & code. If you have any questions feel free to email me at sowalass@msu.edu or sowalassa@outlook.com
